<p class="employment">School of Applied Sciences, Cranfield University. PhD Researcher. Jan. 2008 – Jul. 2011</p>

The research aim was to model and analyse information generation and exchange in telehealth systems and point-of-care devices in managing chronic diseases. Some key achievements include:
<ol class="alpha">
    <li>Reviewing literature to ascertain the state-of-the-art in informatics for point-of-care devices.</li>
    <li>Survey of UK based telehealth organisations, including content analysis and creating symbols to represent their telehealth offerings using Microsoft Visio.</li>
