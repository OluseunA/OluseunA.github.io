<h1>Achievements</h1>

Some highlights of my career to date are listed below:
<ul class="circle">
    <li>
        Designing and developing an electronic diary from a paper version to capture data for a urinary incontinence study. 
        This involved liaising with health professionals to gather requirements before designing and developing the diary and database schema. I also prepared user and technical guides for the variety of user roles for the diary.

    <li>
        Participating in a public engagement project about Telehealth. This was in partnership with Y Touring and other engineers 
        from Cranfield University. It was funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering and involved working with community groups and
         schools to raise awareness of the impact and ethical questions related to Telehealth.

    <li>
